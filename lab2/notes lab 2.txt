Notes: Alex Cherekdjian

3. When I ran the executable, a segmentation fault occurred. This is probably due to not inputing an argument in the command line for the number of delay.

4. As the delay increases (from 500, to 3000, to 5000) the time the process for all the children to be created and parents increases.

Other stuff I learned: After creating two threads, we need to join the threads in order for the program to wait until those threads are done finishing before quiting.
